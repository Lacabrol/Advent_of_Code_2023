# Advent of Code 2023 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2023** repository! 🎅🎁  
This is where I will be sharing my solutions for the daily coding puzzles in the **Advent of Code 2023** challenge.

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event during the month of December. Each day, a new puzzle is released, which challenges participants to solve problems using their favorite programming languages. It's a great way to improve problem-solving skills and learn new techniques while having fun!

## My Goal 🎯
I am working through the puzzles in **Python** (and possibly C++ for some problems) and expect to complete all the challenges by **early November 2024**. This repo will serve as my personal progress tracker, and I'll keep updating it regularly.

## How to Run the Code 💻
To run any of the solutions locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lacabrol/Advent_of_Code_2023.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the day you want to test:
    ```bash
   cd Day1
    ```

3. Run the Python file:
    ```bash
   python AdventDay1.py
    ```

4. Compile the C++ file:
    ```bash
   g++ AdventDay1.cpp -o Advent
    ```

5. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
   ./Advent
    ```
